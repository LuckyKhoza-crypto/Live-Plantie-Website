# DjangoApplication
**Link to hosted website:** https://luckykhoza.pythonanywhere.com/

Developed a Django website where users can login to upload pictures and comment. I'm still working on other parts of the project. For example, soon I will implement an AI that checks whether an image is a plant or not. 
If it's not, it will prevent the user from uploading that image. This will reduce the need for monitoring on my side.

*The code for whole project is not available in this GitHub account. It's in my other one which I use for school. Here is the link to it - https://github.com/LuckyKhoza-crypto/Luckykhoza1-public*
